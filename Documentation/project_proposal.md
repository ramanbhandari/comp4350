# BunkedInn

## Vision

BunkedInn aims to make finding the perfect roommate easy, safe, and stress-free by connecting people based on compatibility, trust, and shared living preferences. We aim to create a platform that fosters harmonious co-living experiences and helps users build long-term, positive roommate relationships.

## Summary

BunkedInn is designed to help users find compatible roommates based on their lifestyles, preferences, and personal habits. The app streamlines the roommate search process by using profile forms, quizzes, and a compatibility scoring system to match users effectively.

## How It Works:

1. **Users sign up** with their email, name, and password.
2. **They complete a personalized profile form** with details like age, gender, and lifestyle habits.
3. **They take a roommate preference quiz** to define their ideal roommate traits (e.g., cleanliness, noise tolerance, pet-friendliness).
4. **The app calculates a compatibility score** and suggests the most suitable roommates.
5. **Users can chat** with potential matches through secure in-app messaging.
6. **After living together, users can leave reviews and ratings** to help others find trustworthy roommates.

By combining structured **user profiles, quizzes, and matching algorithms**, our app ensures a **safe, efficient, and stress-free** roommate search experience.
