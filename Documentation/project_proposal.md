# COMP 4350 Project Proposal - Team 11

## Project Summary and vision

We are developing a Roommate Finder App designed to help people find compatible roommates easily. Our app allows users to sign up, create personal profiles, and complete quizzes about their personalities and preferences, such as pet ownership and cleanliness levels. Using these quiz results, our app calculates a compatibility score to match users with potential roommates.

### Stakeholders

- Users: Individuals seeking roommates.
- Landlords: Property owners who can benefit from tenants finding compatible roommates.
- Previous Tenants: Users who can provide recommendations.

Our vision is to create a safe and efficient platform that simplifies the roommate search process, reduces conflicts, and fosters positive living arrangements.
